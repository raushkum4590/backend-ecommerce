# Circular Dependency Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was failing to start due to a circular dependency between beans:
```
AuthController → UserService → SecurityConfig → JwtAuthFilter → UserDetailsService (UserService) → SecurityConfig
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed JwtAuthFilter.java
- Replaced `@RequiredArgsConstructor` with explicit constructor
- Added `@Lazy` annotation to `UserDetailsService` dependency
- This delays the initialization of UserDetailsService until it's actually needed

```java
@Autowired
public JwtAuthFilter(JwtUtil jwtUtil, @Lazy UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    this.jwtUtil = jwtUtil;
    this.userDetailsService = userDetailsService;
}
```

### 2. Fixed SecurityConfig.java
- Replaced `@RequiredArgsConstructor` with explicit constructor
- Added `@Lazy` annotation to `UserDetailsService` dependency
- This breaks the circular dependency chain

```java
@Autowired
public SecurityConfig(JwtAuthFilter jwtAuthFilter, @Lazy UserDetailsService userDetailsService) {
    this.jwtAuthFilter = jwtAuthFilter;
    this.userDetailsService = userDetailsService;
}
```

## How @Lazy Breaks the Cycle

The `@Lazy` annotation tells Spring to create a proxy for the `UserDetailsService` bean instead of injecting the actual bean immediately. This proxy will only initialize the real bean when a method is actually called on it, breaking the circular dependency at initialization time.

**Dependency Flow After Fix:**
```
AuthController → UserService → SecurityConfig → JwtAuthFilter → UserDetailsService (LAZY PROXY)
                    ↑                                                      |
                    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              (Initialized on first use only)
```

## How to Test

### Option 1: Using IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse)
1. Right-click on `GroceryApplication.java`
2. Select "Run 'GroceryApplication.main()'"
3. The application should start without circular dependency errors

### Option 2: Using Maven Command Line
Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and run:
```cmd
cd "E:\New folder (12)\demo"
mvnw.cmd clean spring-boot:run
```

OR if Maven is installed globally:
```cmd
cd "E:\New folder (12)\demo"
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

### Option 3: Using Maven Wrapper (Recommended)
```cmd
cd "E:\New folder (12)\demo"
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

## Expected Output
If successful, you should see:
```
Started GroceryApplication in X.XXX seconds (JVM running for X.XXX)
```

The application will be available at: `http://localhost:8082`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Application Starts:**
   - Look for "Started GroceryApplication" message
   - No circular dependency errors should appear

2. **Test Public Endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test if products endpoint is accessible
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/products
   
   # Test if categories endpoint is accessible
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/categories
   ```

3. **Test Registration:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/auth/register \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "username": "testuser",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "password123"
   }'
   ```

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `JwtAuthFilter.java` - Added @Lazy to UserDetailsService
2. ✅ `SecurityConfig.java` - Added @Lazy to UserDetailsService

### No Breaking Changes:
- All functionality remains the same
- No API changes
- No database schema changes
- Security configuration unchanged

## If You Still See Errors

If you still encounter circular dependency errors, you can temporarily enable circular references (not recommended for production):

Add to `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.main.allow-circular-references=true
```

However, the @Lazy solution is the proper fix and should work without this property.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Circular dependency resolved using Spring's @Lazy annotation pattern.
